Marketing research team:
  as marsci we want the app to:
    -Show results in a visually pleasing way so that it's easy to understand.
    -Generate genuinely random selections for our focus group participant to ensure we get accurate data.
    -correctly calculate focus group participant's selections to ensure we get acurate data.
    -clearly communicate the instructions to the focus group participant so that they understand what's expected of them
    -


Developer
    as the dev I want the app to:
    -have simple styling so we don't get too bogged down with style before functionality.
    -incorporate an object constructor for each image for simplicity
    -have clear annotation so that we don't get lost in the code,
    -be able to easily add/remove images in case we want to use this app again in the future with other products. 

Focus group participant
    as a focus group participant I want the app to:
    -give me positive feedback after each selection so that my input feels valued
    -instruct me on what's expected of me so that I know how to use the app
    -give clear instructions on what I should expect throughout the use of the app so that I don't become frustrated
    -have large, easily visible images for me to select so that I know what I'm choosing
